This project is a simple linear regression model that predicts salaries based on years of experience. The model was trained on a dataset from [source], and the code was implemented in Python using libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. The repository includes the dataset, Jupyter Notebook with the code, and a README file with instructions on how to run the code and interpret the results.

The graph shows the blue line which is the predicted linear regression that follows simple y=mx+c where y is our prediction and x being the dependent variable
